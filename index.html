            <h1>About My Journey at KSU</h1>
            <p>
			I am currently in my junior year as an undergraduate at Kennesaw State University. 
			My program is a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) with a concentration in Data Analytics and Technology. 
			Since the end of my first year at KSU, I have been actively involved in a co-op position as an IT Josbite Liaison, 
			which I secured through a career fair held at KSU. 
			Kennesaw State University has been more than just an educational institution for me;
			it has been a place of growth, exploration, and community.
