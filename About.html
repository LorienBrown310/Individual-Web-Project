                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Growing up with two parents in IT,
				I always had an interest in technology and problem-solving.
				From an early age, I was fascinated by the way computers
				and software could be used to create solutions and improve
				everyday life. This passion naturally led me to pursue a 
				degree in Information Technology at Kennesaw State University,
				where I could learn more about the world of technology.
				</p>
                <p>As a junior at KSU, I have focused on developing practical
				experience through coursework and working as a co-op. One of
				the most rewarding experiences has been my co-op at McKenney's,
				where, not only have I enhanced my abilities in areas such as troubleshooting
				and technical problem-solving, but it has also taught me the importance
				of teamwork and effective communication. Additionally, my coursework has provided
				a solid foundation in various IT fields, including software development, 
				networking, etc..., further preparing me for a career in the tech industry.
				</p>
                <p>Looking ahead, I am excited to continue my journey in the tech
				industry with innovative companies that are pushing the boundaries
				of technology. I am particularly interested in artificial intelligence
				for Data Analytics and Technology. Overall, I hope
				to use my skills and knowledge to create impactful solutions that
				address real-world challenges and improve the quality of life for
				everyone. </p>
